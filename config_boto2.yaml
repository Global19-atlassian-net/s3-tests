[DEFAULT]
## this section is just used as default for all the "s3 *"
## sections, you can place these variables also directly there

## replace with e.g. "localhost" to run against local software
host = s3.localhost.localdomain

## uncomment the port to use something other than 80
port = 8000

## say "no" to disable TLS
is_secure = no

default_region = 'us-east-1'

[fixtures]
## all the buckets created will start with this prefix;
## {random} will be filled with random characters to pad
## the prefix to 30 characters long, and avoid collisions
bucket prefix = yournamehere-{random}-

[s3 main]
## the tests assume two accounts are defined, "main" and "alt".

## user_id is a 64-character hexstring
user_id = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef

## display name typically looks more like a unix login, "jdoe" etc
display_name = youruseridhere

## replace these with your access keys
access_key =  0555b35654ad1656d804
secret_key = h7GhxuBLTrlhVUyxSPUKUV8r/2EI4ngqJxD7iBdBYLhwluN30JaT3Q==

## replace with key id obtained when secret is created, or delete if KMS not tested
kms_keyid = 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef

[s3 alt]
## another user account, used for ACL-related tests
user_id = 56789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234
